## 2. decisions (by id; DEFAULT = the pack's text; CASE VALUE = this case's filled value)

### PA-D1 — What reflection type dominates each key product surface — diffuse (matte), direct (glossy), or glare?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Declare a finish per named object before any prompt is written and light for the declared finish; the three reflection types are a contrast set (scs_lsm_c003_001) — finish is a property of the surface, not of the light.
- **CASE VALUE:** juice_bottle: direct glossy glass with condensation (many small diffuse droplets over a direct surface — declared); liquid: translucent; slate: semi-gloss wet; orange slices: matte pulp with a wet sheen.

### PA-D2 — Where may the highlight sit on each glossy surface?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** One highlight per surface, consistent with one implied source placed inside or outside the family of angles by intent (scs_lsm_c003_002); the reflection reports the source's size.
- **CASE VALUE:** One long soft window highlight down the bottle's left side from a single large source camera-left; the reveal must not sweep a second highlight across the glass.

### PA-D3 — Hard or soft source?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Large/soft relative to subject for product surfaces unless the brief forces drama; choose the instrument for the shadow edge it must produce (sk_alt_c003_0006); for direct reflection the source's size sets the highlight's size (sk_lsm_c003_0014).
- **CASE VALUE:** Large soft source; soft shadow; the highlight large.

### PA-D4 — What is the fictional light source, and does everything agree with it?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Name the fictional source first, then place the key to agree with it (sk_alt_c003_0011); build in the working order of scs_alt_c003_002 — one source photographs flat, added lights restore roundness (sk_alt_c003_0009), interiors imitate daylight's structure (0008); keep one consistent direction because audiences read light without being taught (0026).
- **CASE VALUE:** Fictional source: a low morning window camera-left; one direction for the whole move.

### PA-D5 — How does the product separate from its ground?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** By tonal separation, either direction (sk_alt_c003_0015). Scope rule: 0015 governs subject-against-ground; the dark-to-light progression (0017) governs only staged depth planes. Cold, plain grounds separate warm subjects (0003); a deliberately shiny prop (0004) trades off against a quiet ground — decide per object, never both on one surface.
- **CASE VALUE:** Warm orange against cool dark wet slate (sk_alt_c003_0003); nearer slate darker than the lit far ground (0017, staged planes).

### PA-D6 — What key level does the mood require?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Set the key by genre and mood before lighting anything (sk_alt_c003_0018); let level follow the dramatic line (0022); make mood with the character of the light, not exposure (0025); the fictional source still governs (0011).
- **CASE VALUE:** Low key, cinematic; mood from side light and the dark ground, not from underexposure.

### PA-D7 — Does the imagery earn its space commercially?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Treat the picture as a salesman that must earn its space (sk_hop_sa_0026); assume the viewer decides from a glance at headline or picture (0035); size imagery by importance to the sale, never decoration.
- **CASE VALUE:** Sells at a glance: 'cold, fresh, real glass'.

### PA-D8 — Glass, dark or mirror-glossy object in frame — special handling?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Dark subjects reveal direct reflection because they produce less diffuse reflection (sk_lsm_c003_0017); on black-on-black, capitalize on it — light black as if it were metal, find and fill the family (sk_lsmx_0057). Use the diagnostic guidelines to identify polarized reflection (0018). Polarizing the source makes a reflection manageable (0019), but it sits late in the remedy ladder on cost grounds: try a darker background, the source toward the camera, and camera height first (sk_lsmx_0023); cross-polarizing source and lens buys freedom from geometry only at a large cost (sk_lsmx_0009). Polarized direct reflection is dimmer than ordinary direct reflection (0015).
- **CASE VALUE:** Glass: the one wanted highlight; the wet slate's reflection of the bottle is wanted; no accidental hot spots.

### PA-D9 — Which angle is the hero angle?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** The angle showing the most surfaces of the product (sk_alt_c003_0010) — Canon's only committed angle-choice criterion.
- **LIMIT (pack text):** Packshot convention absent from Canon (A13 application_unbound): hero-angle, label-legibility and scale-cue conventions are not in the corpus; this default is one 1949 cinema-era claim — do not overgeneralize.
- **CASE VALUE:** Three-quarter from slightly above at the end of the move: front, shoulder, cap top.

### PA-D10 — When may any of the above be overridden?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Technique serves a creative decision it does not make (sk_lsm_c003_0020): any default in this pack yields to an explicit creative decision recorded in DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS with the brief clause that forces it.
- **CASE VALUE:** No deviation.

### CA-D1 — What reads first, second, third?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One dominant element by contrast — visual power is achieved by contrast, not 'impact' (vig_0009); eyes attract more strongly than probably any other subject (fre_0020); competing cues confuse rather than direct (repeated focus-shifting is the type case, ms_0019); complete control of attention is self-defeating (murch_0018); misdirection (murch_0033) is the scoped exception, only to set up a reveal.
- **CASE VALUE:** 1st read: the bottle (warm on dark); 2nd: the droplets catching light; 3rd: the slices.

### CA-D2 — Where does the subject sit in frame?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Off-centre within one of three approximate zones (fre_001; fre_0017, 0018); centre only when the scene points inward (0019); extreme placement needs a visible reason (0021). The source rejects coordinate rules (0016, vs its nod to classical proportion, 0028): zones are regions, never grids or named ratios.
- **CASE VALUE:** Bottle ends right of centre; slices lower-left.

### CA-D3 — How does the frame hold the subject at its edges?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One edge treatment per shot (fre_002): tight fit with a slight deliberate gap (fre_0006); busy scene, edges stop mattering (0005); deliberate halving of a symmetrical subject (0007). Straight subject edges near frame edges read magnetic (0003); thin any bright framing element (0004).
- **CASE VALUE:** Tight fit with a deliberate gap at the end frame (fre_0006); the move must not clip the cap.

### CA-D5 — Balance the frame, or refuse the eye rest?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Classical balance is the default; it weighs size AND tone together (fre_0028, 0029; fre_005); refusing the eye a resting place (0032) is the declared energetic exception. Symmetry imposes order on a subject that has none (0030); diagonals need strict horizontals and verticals to divide against (0033, 0034 per CF-07).
- **CASE VALUE:** Balanced.

### CA-D6 — Which orientation and aspect?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Choose by the scene's shapes (fre_003): a vertical frame is not itself tallness (fre_0008); a square reads strict and draws the eye inward (0009, 0010); a wide frame needs shapes that call for it (0011).
- **LIMIT (pack text):** No accepted source treats fixed 9:16 feed frames (A01/G2): every aspect and orientation claim here predates vertical-feed formats; transfer is untested.
- **CASE VALUE:** 9:16 justified by the tall bottle; CA-D6 LIMIT noted.

### CA-D7 — How does attention travel across cuts (video)?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Every new shot carries new information (gote_0004) and every departure is motivated (0006); drive eye-trace by alternating frame placement (0010), keeping difficulty near the optimum (0011); composition must differ at the cut (0026) — the wipe waives it (0035). Alternatives: move attention inside one continuous shot (ms_0010; ms_002), or block with a static wide (0017). One device per beat.
- **CASE VALUE:** One continuous shot; device: camera move (the reveal). No cut.

### CA-D10 — How long may a shot hold?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Set length by silently describing the shot's contents; the description's time is the shot's (gote_0053). The fast-cutting norm — which the source calls alarming — is the ambient pace (0052).
- **CASE VALUE:** 6 s: 'a slow drift from dark slate up to a cold bottle in side light' (gote_0053).

### CA-D11 — Does the camera move, and why?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Every move is motivated and stillness is chosen (ms_0002); an object in transit licenses a move across a location (0011); do the most with the least (murch_0015); shared success criterion: the technique goes unnoticed (ms_0018; ms_003).
- **CASE VALUE:** Motivated move: the reveal is the commercial event (ms_0002); slow dolly-in from low, no other motion.

### DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS

- PA-D10: No deviation.

## 3. text_handling

- mode: `none`

## 4. dispatch_parameters (identical for every route; route mapping only in `TEST-CASES.yaml` → `routes[].params`)

- aspect: 9:16
- duration_s: 6
- resolution: 720p
- audio: on (ambient only)
- reference_slots: 0

## 5. pre_dispatch_checks (the packs' CHECK lines, by id, run over the prompt before any call)

- `PA-D1-check`: Every key object has exactly one declared finish; two surfaces of the same tone still read differently by finish; no surface reads as both matte and mirror-glossy in one shot.
- `PA-D2-check`: Highlight positions agree with the single implied source; highlight brightness does not fall off with implied source distance; a large soft source reads as a large reflection, never a hard point.
- `PA-D3-check`: Shadow edge quality and highlight size agree — a soft shadow with a pinpoint specular, or the reverse, is a lighting contradiction.
- `PA-D4-check`: One nameable fictional source; key direction agrees with it; no shadow in frame contradicts the declared direction.
- `PA-D5-check`: Product-to-ground tonal contrast survives a grayscale check; where depth planes are staged, nearer planes are darker than farther ones.
- `PA-D6-check`: Mood is attributable to light character — direction, hardness, contrast — not to a brightness slider; the key level is declared and consistent across shots.
- `PA-D7-check`: State in one line what the hero image sells at a glance; if that line needs the body copy, the image fails.
- `PA-D8-check`: Every specular on glass, dark or glossy surfaces is declared wanted or removed; none is accidental.
- `PA-D9-check`: Count visible faces of the product; if a candidate angle shows more surfaces without breaking PA-D2 or PA-D5, prefer it.
- `PA-D10-check`: Every deviation from PA-D1..PA-D9 is listed in DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS with its forcing brief clause; none is silent.
- `CA-D1-check`: Name the 1st/2nd/3rd read; each carried by exactly one dominant cue; no two cues compete for one beat.
- `CA-D2-check`: Placement is stated as a zone plus the reason for it; no placement is justified by a named ratio or grid line.
- `CA-D3-check`: The edge treatment is one of the three, named; no accidental near-tangency between a subject edge and a frame edge.
- `CA-D5-check`: Declared balanced or deliberately restless; if balanced, a grayscale check shows tonal weight agreeing with size weight.
- `CA-D6-check`: The stated aspect is justified by a named shape in the scene, not by the platform alone.
- `CA-D7-check`: Per cut, name the new information and motivation; per beat, state the one device: cut, camera move, or blocking.
- `CA-D10-check`: No shot outlasts its describable content; the stated pace names the prevailing norm it assumes.
- `CA-D11-check`: Each camera move names its motivation; unmotivated moves are replaced by stillness or a cut.
- `no-in-image-text`: the generation prompt includes an explicit no-lettering instruction and names no string; any lettering in the output is a reject (E5), never an exclusion.
- pack limit (`composition_and_attention`): Devanagari correctness criteria do not exist in Canon — never generate Devanagari glyphs; composite text deterministically.
- pack limit (`product_appearance`): Devanagari correctness criteria do not exist in Canon — never generate Devanagari glyphs; composite text deterministically.

## 6. generation_prompt (byte-identical across every route listed for this case)

```text
Vertical cinematic product clip, one continuous shot, 6 seconds. A 250 ml clear glass bottle of orange juice with a blank label and a metal cap stands on a wet dark slate surface, beaded with condensation, two orange slices lower-left of it. Low morning light from a window on the left, one long soft highlight down the bottle's left side, the wet slate reflecting the bottle, soft shadow to the right. The camera begins low and close on the dark wet slate and drifts slowly upward and inward to reveal the whole bottle, ending in a three-quarter view from slightly above with the bottle right of centre and a small gap above the cap. The bottle never moves. No people, no hands. Only soft ambient room sound; no voice, no music. No text, labels, logos or lettering anywhere in any frame.
```
