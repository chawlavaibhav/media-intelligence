## 1. packs_selected (deterministic lookup from the Normalized Request; `compiled` = injected by id, `uncompiled` = listed only, no doctrine drawn)

- `concept_and_distinctiveness` — uncompiled — universal
- `critique_and_effectiveness` — uncompiled — universal
- `composition_and_attention` — compiled — base:static_image (R05)
- `colour_and_visual_register` — uncompiled — base:static_image (R05)
- `indian_indic_context` — uncompiled — language_topology_present_or_market_IN (R10; market IN for every case)
- `commercial_communication` — uncompiled — advertising_acceptance_intent (R18)

## 2. decisions (by id; DEFAULT = the pack's text; CASE VALUE = this case's filled value)

### CA-D1 — What reads first, second, third?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One dominant element by contrast — visual power is achieved by contrast, not 'impact' (vig_0009); eyes attract more strongly than probably any other subject (fre_0020); competing cues confuse rather than direct (repeated focus-shifting is the type case, ms_0019); complete control of attention is self-defeating (murch_0018); misdirection (murch_0033) is the scoped exception, only to set up a reveal.
- **CASE VALUE:** 1st read: her face and smile (fre_0020); 2nd: the open laptop; 3rd: the cafe depth. One cue each.

### CA-D2 — Where does the subject sit in frame?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Off-centre within one of three approximate zones (fre_001; fre_0017, 0018); centre only when the scene points inward (0019); extreme placement needs a visible reason (0021). The source rejects coordinate rules (0016, vs its nod to classical proportion, 0028): zones are regions, never grids or named ratios.
- **CASE VALUE:** Off-centre, right zone, cafe depth to the left (fre_0018).

### CA-D3 — How does the frame hold the subject at its edges?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One edge treatment per shot (fre_002): tight fit with a slight deliberate gap (fre_0006); busy scene, edges stop mattering (0005); deliberate halving of a symmetrical subject (0007). Straight subject edges near frame edges read magnetic (0003); thin any bright framing element (0004).
- **CASE VALUE:** Busy scene: edges stop mattering (fre_0005); no tangency of head and frame.

### CA-D4 — Use a frame within the frame?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** No compulsion (fre_0022); when a subject passes behind an opening, the near-universal reaction is to shoot the moment it sits cleanly inside, breaking no edges; thin a bright framing element or it takes over (0004).
- **CASE VALUE:** None used.

### CA-D5 — Balance the frame, or refuse the eye rest?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Classical balance is the default; it weighs size AND tone together (fre_0028, 0029; fre_005); refusing the eye a resting place (0032) is the declared energetic exception. Symmetry imposes order on a subject that has none (0030); diagonals need strict horizontals and verticals to divide against (0033, 0034 per CF-07).
- **CASE VALUE:** Balanced: her tonal weight against the brighter window side.

### CA-D6 — Which orientation and aspect?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Choose by the scene's shapes (fre_003): a vertical frame is not itself tallness (fre_0008); a square reads strict and draws the eye inward (0009, 0010); a wide frame needs shapes that call for it (0011).
- **LIMIT (pack text):** No accepted source treats fixed 9:16 feed frames (A01/G2): every aspect and orientation claim here predates vertical-feed formats; transfer is untested.
- **CASE VALUE:** 4:5 justified by the seated figure and the vertical window behind.

### DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS

- none — every applicable default is accepted as written.

### 2a. Production parameters outside the triggered packs (brief-only; not Canon)

The `product_appearance` pack is not triggered for this Normalized Request (no product or packshot entity), so its lighting doctrine is not injected. The parameters below are the Executor's production choices on the brief alone and are attributed to nothing in Canon.

- light/mood: (scene light) Fictional source: cafe window camera-left, morning; key on the face agrees; one direction.
- light/mood: (person) Skin's small direct reflection is kept.

## 3. text_handling

- mode: `none`

## 4. dispatch_parameters (identical for every route; route mapping only in `TEST-CASES.yaml` → `routes[].params`)

- aspect: 4:5
- resolution: ~1 MP
- audio: not_applicable
- reference_slots: 3

## 5. pre_dispatch_checks (the packs' CHECK lines, by id, run over the prompt before any call)

- `CA-D1-check`: Name the 1st/2nd/3rd read; each carried by exactly one dominant cue; no two cues compete for one beat.
- `CA-D2-check`: Placement is stated as a zone plus the reason for it; no placement is justified by a named ratio or grid line.
- `CA-D3-check`: The edge treatment is one of the three, named; no accidental near-tangency between a subject edge and a frame edge.
- `CA-D4-check`: A framing element used is darker or thinner than the subject it frames.
- `CA-D5-check`: Declared balanced or deliberately restless; if balanced, a grayscale check shows tonal weight agreeing with size weight.
- `CA-D6-check`: The stated aspect is justified by a named shape in the scene, not by the platform alone.
- `no-in-image-text`: the generation prompt includes an explicit no-lettering instruction and names no string; any lettering in the output is a reject (E5), never an exclusion.
- pack limit (`composition_and_attention`): Devanagari correctness criteria do not exist in Canon — never generate Devanagari glyphs; composite text deterministically.

## 6. generation_prompt (byte-identical across every route listed for this case)

```text
Natural lifestyle photograph of the woman in the reference images — the same face, hair and build — seated at a small cafe table with an open laptop, smiling at the camera. Casual outfit. Soft morning window light from the left, one direction, gentle shadows. She sits right of centre; the cafe recedes to the left. The laptop screen is dark and shows nothing. Correct hands and face. No text, no signage, no lettering, no logos, no numerals anywhere in the image.
