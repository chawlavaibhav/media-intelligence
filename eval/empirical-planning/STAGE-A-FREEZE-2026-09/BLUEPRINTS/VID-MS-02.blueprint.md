## 2. decisions (by id; DEFAULT = the pack's text; CASE VALUE = this case's filled value)

### PA-D1 — What reflection type dominates each key product surface — diffuse (matte), direct (glossy), or glare?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Declare a finish per named object before any prompt is written and light for the declared finish; the three reflection types are a contrast set (scs_lsm_c003_001) — finish is a property of the surface, not of the light.
- **CASE VALUE:** mattress: matte fabric; bedsheets: matte; skin: diffuse.

### PA-D4 — What is the fictional light source, and does everything agree with it?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Name the fictional source first, then place the key to agree with it (sk_alt_c003_0011); build in the working order of scs_alt_c003_002 — one source photographs flat, added lights restore roundness (sk_alt_c003_0009), interiors imitate daylight's structure (0008); keep one consistent direction because audiences read light without being taught (0026).
- **CASE VALUE:** Shot 1: a single dim street-lamp glow through the window camera-left; shot 2: morning window camera-left; shot 3: bright morning window camera-left — one fictional source, brightening (scs_alt_c003_002).

### PA-D5 — How does the product separate from its ground?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** By tonal separation, either direction (sk_alt_c003_0015). Scope rule: 0015 governs subject-against-ground; the dark-to-light progression (0017) governs only staged depth planes. Cold, plain grounds separate warm subjects (0003); a deliberately shiny prop (0004) trades off against a quiet ground — decide per object, never both on one surface.
- **CASE VALUE:** Shot 2: the pale mattress against a mid-tone floor; contrast survives grayscale.

### PA-D6 — What key level does the mood require?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Set the key by genre and mood before lighting anything (sk_alt_c003_0018); let level follow the dramatic line (0022); make mood with the character of the light, not exposure (0025); the fictional source still governs (0011).
- **CASE VALUE:** Key level follows the dramatic line (sk_alt_c003_0022): low → medium → high across the three shots; mood by light character (0025), not exposure alone.

### PA-D7 — Does the imagery earn its space commercially?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Treat the picture as a salesman that must earn its space (sk_hop_sa_0026); assume the viewer decides from a glance at headline or picture (0035); size imagery by importance to the sale, never decoration.
- **CASE VALUE:** Sells at a glance: 'from restless nights to real sleep — the mattress is the turn'.

### PA-D9 — Which angle is the hero angle?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** The angle showing the most surfaces of the product (sk_alt_c003_0010) — Canon's only committed angle-choice criterion.
- **LIMIT (pack text):** Packshot convention absent from Canon (A13 application_unbound): hero-angle, label-legibility and scale-cue conventions are not in the corpus; this default is one 1949 cinema-era claim — do not overgeneralize.
- **CASE VALUE:** Shot 2: three-quarter from slightly above showing top and one side of the mattress.

### PA-D10 — When may any of the above be overridden?

- **DEFAULT (product_appearance):** Technique serves a creative decision it does not make (sk_lsm_c003_0020): any default in this pack yields to an explicit creative decision recorded in DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS with the brief clause that forces it.
- **CASE VALUE:** No deviation.

### CA-D1 — What reads first, second, third?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One dominant element by contrast — visual power is achieved by contrast, not 'impact' (vig_0009); eyes attract more strongly than probably any other subject (fre_0020); competing cues confuse rather than direct (repeated focus-shifting is the type case, ms_0019); complete control of attention is self-defeating (murch_0018); misdirection (murch_0033) is the scoped exception, only to set up a reveal.
- **CASE VALUE:** Shot 1: the turning body; shot 2: the mattress; shot 3: the calm face (fre_0020). One cue per shot.

### CA-D2 — Where does the subject sit in frame?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Off-centre within one of three approximate zones (fre_001; fre_0017, 0018); centre only when the scene points inward (0019); extreme placement needs a visible reason (0021). The source rejects coordinate rules (0016, vs its nod to classical proportion, 0028): zones are regions, never grids or named ratios.
- **CASE VALUE:** Shot 1 figure right of centre; shot 2 mattress centred (points inward); shot 3 face left of centre — alternating placement (gote_0010).

### CA-D3 — How does the frame hold the subject at its edges?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** One edge treatment per shot (fre_002): tight fit with a slight deliberate gap (fre_0006); busy scene, edges stop mattering (0005); deliberate halving of a symmetrical subject (0007). Straight subject edges near frame edges read magnetic (0003); thin any bright framing element (0004).
- **CASE VALUE:** Tight fit with a gap in shots 2 and 3; shot 1 busy in shadow (fre_0005).

### CA-D5 — Balance the frame, or refuse the eye rest?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Classical balance is the default; it weighs size AND tone together (fre_0028, 0029; fre_005); refusing the eye a resting place (0032) is the declared energetic exception. Symmetry imposes order on a subject that has none (0030); diagonals need strict horizontals and verticals to divide against (0033, 0034 per CF-07).
- **CASE VALUE:** Balanced in all three.

### CA-D6 — Which orientation and aspect?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Choose by the scene's shapes (fre_003): a vertical frame is not itself tallness (fre_0008); a square reads strict and draws the eye inward (0009, 0010); a wide frame needs shapes that call for it (0011).
- **LIMIT (pack text):** No accepted source treats fixed 9:16 feed frames (A01/G2): every aspect and orientation claim here predates vertical-feed formats; transfer is untested.
- **CASE VALUE:** 9:16 justified by the bed seen from the foot end (a tall shape).

### CA-D7 — How does attention travel across cuts (video)?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Every new shot carries new information (gote_0004) and every departure is motivated (0006); drive eye-trace by alternating frame placement (0010), keeping difficulty near the optimum (0011); composition must differ at the cut (0026) — the wipe waives it (0035). Alternatives: move attention inside one continuous shot (ms_0010; ms_002), or block with a static wide (0017). One device per beat.
- **CASE VALUE:** Cut 1: new information = the mattress; motivation = the restless turn. Cut 2: new information = peace; motivation = the light. Composition differs at both cuts (gote_0026). One device per beat: blocking.

### CA-D8 — When cut criteria conflict, what is sacrificed first?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Murch's Rule of Six (murch_001; murch_0019): emotion 51 (0020) > story 23 (0021) > rhythm 10 (0022) > eye-trace 7 (0023) > planarity 5 (0024) > 3D space 4 (0025). Aim to satisfy all six (0031); else sacrifice upward from the bottom (0027) — higher criteria obscure failures of lower ones, never the reverse (0028). Weights hedged, intervals the point (0029); top three bind tightly (0030); 'bad' is film-relative (0011); the list serves occupying the audience's position (0032).
- **CASE VALUE:** Sacrifice from the bottom: planarity or 3D space before rhythm; never the emotion of the calm ending (murch_0027).

### CA-D9 — Screen direction and the line?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Frame edges are the audience's directional reference (gos_0005); keep setups within one 180-degree arc (0010; gos_001); movement and position persist across cuts (gote_0017, 0018; gos_0011); reciprocal coverage obeys the line (gote_0056). A far-side setup is good in itself — the reversal shows only at the cut (gos_0012, contradicting 0007/0010); crossing needs a declared creative reason (0013).
- **CASE VALUE:** The bed's head stays at frame-top in every shot; the sleeper's side of frame persists (gote_0018).

### CA-D10 — How long may a shot hold?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Set length by silently describing the shot's contents; the description's time is the shot's (gote_0053). The fast-cutting norm — which the source calls alarming — is the ambient pace (0052).
- **CASE VALUE:** 10 s ≈ 3 + 3 + 4: 'someone turns over in the dark', 'a mattress in morning light', 'they sleep, at peace' (gote_0053).

### CA-D11 — Does the camera move, and why?

- **DEFAULT (composition_and_attention):** Every move is motivated and stillness is chosen (ms_0002); an object in transit licenses a move across a location (0011); do the most with the least (murch_0015); shared success criterion: the technique goes unnoticed (ms_0018; ms_003).
- **CASE VALUE:** All three shots still; stillness chosen (ms_0002).

### DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS

- PA-D10: No deviation.

## 3. text_handling

- mode: `none`

## 4. dispatch_parameters (identical for every route; route mapping only in `TEST-CASES.yaml` → `routes[].params`)

- aspect: 9:16
- duration_s: 10
- resolution: 720p
- audio: off
- reference_slots: 0

## 5. pre_dispatch_checks (the packs' CHECK lines, by id, run over the prompt before any call)

- `PA-D1-check`: Every key object has exactly one declared finish; two surfaces of the same tone still read differently by finish; no surface reads as both matte and mirror-glossy in one shot.
- `PA-D4-check`: One nameable fictional source; key direction agrees with it; no shadow in frame contradicts the declared direction.
- `PA-D5-check`: Product-to-ground tonal contrast survives a grayscale check; where depth planes are staged, nearer planes are darker than farther ones.
- `PA-D6-check`: Mood is attributable to light character — direction, hardness, contrast — not to a brightness slider; the key level is declared and consistent across shots.
- `PA-D7-check`: State in one line what the hero image sells at a glance; if that line needs the body copy, the image fails.
- `PA-D9-check`: Count visible faces of the product; if a candidate angle shows more surfaces without breaking PA-D2 or PA-D5, prefer it.
- `PA-D10-check`: Every deviation from PA-D1..PA-D9 is listed in DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS with its forcing brief clause; none is silent.
- `CA-D1-check`: Name the 1st/2nd/3rd read; each carried by exactly one dominant cue; no two cues compete for one beat.
- `CA-D2-check`: Placement is stated as a zone plus the reason for it; no placement is justified by a named ratio or grid line.
- `CA-D3-check`: The edge treatment is one of the three, named; no accidental near-tangency between a subject edge and a frame edge.
- `CA-D5-check`: Declared balanced or deliberately restless; if balanced, a grayscale check shows tonal weight agreeing with size weight.
- `CA-D6-check`: The stated aspect is justified by a named shape in the scene, not by the platform alone.
- `CA-D7-check`: Per cut, name the new information and motivation; per beat, state the one device: cut, camera move, or blocking.
- `CA-D8-check`: An imperfect cut names the bottom criteria sacrificed; never sacrifice emotion for eye-trace, planarity or 3D continuity.
- `CA-D9-check`: Screen direction and side-of-frame persist across consecutive shots, or something on screen shows the change (gos_0007), or the crossing is declared in DOCTRINE_DEVIATIONS.
- `CA-D10-check`: No shot outlasts its describable content; the stated pace names the prevailing norm it assumes.
- `CA-D11-check`: Each camera move names its motivation; unmotivated moves are replaced by stillness or a cut.
- `no-in-image-text`: the generation prompt includes an explicit no-lettering instruction and names no string; any lettering in the output is a reject (E5), never an exclusion.
- pack limit (`composition_and_attention`): Devanagari correctness criteria do not exist in Canon — never generate Devanagari glyphs; composite text deterministically.
- pack limit (`product_appearance`): Devanagari correctness criteria do not exist in Canon — never generate Devanagari glyphs; composite text deterministically.

## 6. generation_prompt (byte-identical across every route listed for this case)

```text
Vertical video, 10 seconds, three shots with straight cuts, silent. Shot 1 (about 3 s, static camera): a dim bedroom at night, faint street-lamp glow through a window on the left; a woman in her thirties lies on a bed seen from the foot end, right of centre, turning restlessly. Shot 2 (about 3 s, static camera): the bare mattress on its frame, centred, clean, in soft morning window light from the left, three-quarter view from slightly above. Shot 3 (about 4 s, static camera): the same woman, same face and hair, now asleep on the made bed, left of centre, still and calm, the room bright with morning light from the left. Dark to light across the three shots; the head of the bed at the top of frame in every shot. No text, captions, logos or lettering anywhere in any frame.
